Raw Project Description:

For this project you will create an app, written entirely in Objective-C, that makes use of UICollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions.

You are welcome to select a domain of your choice, and to incorporate other features and tools, but please make sure the four required items listed above are implemented. In addition, the collection view cells must be interactive and networking should make use of proper error handling.
Topic of interest:

	â€¢	An API-driven crypto-currency app where cells represent particular coin. Gestures could be used to display alternate views or data about the coins
	
You can utilize third party libraries to add more advanced features. Please make sure that your primary implementation of: UICollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions are developed by yourself, not from a library. If third party libraries are used elsewhere, please provide detailed comment and instruction for usage and installation such that the project can be reviewed properly.
